# dataset preparation for model training

* ### frame.py
I have developed a script that will records a frame in every 5 frames from a video that you will give as an input.


* ### label_operations.py
I developed a program that calculates the maximum-minimum and average label size, allowing you to navigate over the labels you print out in the yolo type - without worrying about the missing labels.

* ### labelcontrol.py
I developed a program that hovers over the labels and shows you the missing labels.
